<h1>Health Care!</h1>
<h3>Project Idea</h3>
<p>I was thinking about appointment booking system of doctors . From Patient's side, people remain disturbed already and the harrasment
they face while booking an appointment of doctor increases their pain, specially who live far away from doctor's location.
A website from where people can book appointment from online easily,  will be really helpful to them. Moreover, they can find all neccessary
information of doctors according to their need.</p>

<h3>Features</h3>
1. Login System for both patient and doctor.<br>
2. Public can show all the necessary information (ex: name, chamber location, visiting hours, fees etc) 
of Specialist doctors of all departments.<br>
3. Only registered user can book appointments of registered doctors.<br>
4. People can get to know about ambulance services, hospitals and other health information in the city.<br>
5. An user can update his/her profile.<br>

<h3>Platform</h3>

<h3>Tools</h3>
